## Build out a Diner Menu using JavaScript

Build out a Diner menu in JAVASCRIPT. Here are your instructions to build that Diner.
Bottega Diner
Have the Main Menu and a Sides Menu
You get one entree and two side choices at regular cost.
- show them the entire menu (print out)
- A user selects an entree.
- “Waitress” makes a comment based on their selection
- comment can either be a comparison of the two items, or random comment pulled from a comment vault.
- Tell them the price
- repeat the above options for side choices (comment and a price)
- total up the cost

BONUS
Have breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu. Breakfast has different items, lunch and dinner have the same items but are different prices.

BONUS: Allow for item customization (how items are prepared, decide additional cost implications)
